# Lexica

 **Lexica** is a full-stack web playground for my custom programming language.  
Write code in the browser, hit **Run**, and see results instantly.

### Features
-  Browser-based code editor (React + Monaco)
-  Backend execution engine built in **pure Java** (custom HTTP server, no frameworks)
-  Powered by my own custom compiler

### Why Lexica?
Most online playgrounds rely on frameworks and libraries.  
Lexica shows that I can build the **entire stack from scratch** — from the compiler to the web server to the UI.
